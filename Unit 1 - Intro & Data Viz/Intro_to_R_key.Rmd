Currently you are working in an R markdown document. This is a very useful document because it allows both annotation and code chunks. The code chunks are the areas in grey and each code chunk can be run by pressing the small green arrow in the top right of that chunk. The code chunk will then run in the console (where commands run in R) and the output will appear in the notebook below that chunk.

We will be working with a dataset called 'present', which includes the number of individuals assigned a sex of boy or girl at birth in the United States from 1940-2002.

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Do not be afraid to google! Googling is a GREAT resource to tackle problems while coding. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. There are excellent tutorials for EVERYTHING we will cover in this course, as well as forums where you can find answers to your questions, along with explanations from expert programmers. 

A word of caution... you may also be tempted to use generative AI sources to help with your coding throughout this course, such as ChatGPT. ChatGPT can be helpful for asking questions and getting guidance, but for the purposes of this course, do NOT use it to generate either code or explanations that you use on exercises, homework, or quizzes as this constitutes a violation of the Davidson Honor Code. ChatGPT can serve as a helpful teacher and search engine, but it's not infallible and may provide incorrect information. Furthermore, relying to heavily on this tool will rob you of the opportunity to learn this material on your own and to understand the logic of your code. For more advice and caution, see: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2023/04/tips-for-using-chatgpt-to-learn-r/. 

Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Then, we will move into data visualization.

IMPORTANT! Before you get started, you should always *set your working directory.* This is the folder that you are pulling data from and where your output files will go. Since we're working on Jupyter Hub, that is in your directory stored on Davidson's server (it is not on your local computer).  

You can manually set the directory by going to the top, clicking on 'Session' and selecting 'Set Working Directory'. Note, however, that in order for your code to properly knit at the end, this command with the correct path must be included in your code! 

```{r}
setwd("???")
```

1) First, let's load the present data.  Note that the code below is written in a "chunk", which surrounds your code with two lines that each contain three tickbacks.  After the first set of backticks, the code {r} is needed to convey that the subsequent lines contain a chunk of code. 

You can run this code in a few ways.  One way is to click on the green right-pointing arrow on the right side of the chunk.  Another way is to place your cursor anywhere within the line that you want to run and click Ctrl+Enter for Windows or Cmd+Return for Macs. 

```{r}
source("http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/present.R")
```

You should now see the present dataset listed in the Environment tab in the top right window of RStudio.  It is a datafile with 63 observations and 3 variables.  Note that it is labeled as present in R, and because it has a label, we can refer to it in our code.


2) Let's look at the first six rows of the dataset.  We'll use the head() function.

```{r}
head(present)
```

Q: How many columns are there?  What do the columns represent?  What do the rows represent?

A: There are three columns: year, boys, and girls.  Each row includes data for a different year.



3) Now let's look at the last six rows in the dataset using the tail() function.  Replace the ??? with the appropriate code before running.

```{r}
tail(present)
```


4) Let's explore the range of years included in this dataset.  We will be referring to a specific column within the present dataset, which we can do using the $ sign with the following format:

dataset_name$variable_name

Use the min(), max(), and range() functions to examine the range of years present in the dataset.  

```{r}
min(present$year)

max(present$year)

range(present$year)
```

Q: Why do you think that min(), max(), and range() are more reliable for determining the span of years present in the dataset than head() and tail()?

A: A dataset may not include data in order by year, which means the head() and tail() functions might now display the first and last year in the dataset.  The range() function will return the minimum and maximum values regardless of what order they are in.


5) Let's see if the ratio of babies assigned as boys or girls at birth has changed over time.

We can easily create and name new variables in R.  For example, let's make the variables A and B and save their sum as C.

```{r}
A<-5

B<-3

C<-A+B

C
```

We can also do this with vectors of numbers.  Note that R requires that vectors be identified using the c() notation.

```{r}
X<-c(A, B)
X
```


To calculate the ratio of boys and girls in the present datset, we can divide one column of data (boys) by another column of data (girls) and saving the output as a new variable in present (which we will call ratio).

```{r}
present$ratio = present$boys / present$girls
```



6) Let's make a plot of the ratio over time.  We can do this with the plot() function using the notation plot(x, y), where the x and y arguments are where you will specify which variable you want displayed along the x and y axes.

```{r}
plot(present$year, present$ratio)
```

Q: Has the ratio of babies assigned boy vs. girl at birth changed over time?

A: All values are slightly above 1, which shows that slightly more boys are born than girls each year.  However, the ratio seems to be decreasing over time, although it may be cyclical.  It would be interesting to see the past 20 years of data.


7) Let's customize our graph of ratio over time.  Here is an explanation of the arguments:

xlim=c(): set the range of the x-axis. Within the c(), list the min and max of the range separated by a comma.

ylim=c(): set the range of the y-axis. Within the c(), list the min and max of the range separated by a comma.

xlab="": specify the x-axis label.  This must be in quotes.

ylab="": specify the y-axis label.  This must be in quotes.

main="": specify the title of the graph.  This must be in quotes.  To remove a title that is automatically displayed, leave an empty space between the quotes.

col="": specify the color of the points, lines, bars, boxplots, etc. If you are naming a color, it must be in quotes.  To list more than one color, you need to list them within c() and separated by a comma, with each color within quotes.  To see a list of some (but not all) of colors you can specify in R, see this image: https://derekogle.com/NCGraphing/img/colorbynames.png

pch=: only for scatterplots, you can specify the symbol plotted with a number or symbol as you see in this image: https://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/images/points.png 

```{r}
plot(present$year, present$ratio, xlim=c(1940, 2010), ylim=c(1.045, 1.06), xlab="Year", ylab="Ratio of boys to girls", main=" ", col="goldenrod", pch=21)
```



8) Let's practice turning this R markdown document into a PDF file as if you were submitting it as an assignment.  Click on the drop down arrow next to the Knit button above, which has a symbol of yarn and a knitting needle.  Select "Knit to PDF".  Note that this won't work if you have any problematic code in your R markdown document.  To check for issues, scroll up your R markdown file and make sure that you don't see any red Xs next to any of the code chunks.
